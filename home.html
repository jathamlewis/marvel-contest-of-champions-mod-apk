<h2>Tips for playing Marvel Contest of Champions</h2>
<p>Whether you are new to these types of games or not, Marvel Contest of Champions APK has some unique features that you should know if you are about to succeed in the game. Here are some of our top tips for playing the game &ndash; beginners and pros alike, there's always something new to learn!</p>
<p>Pay attention to class bonuses. Some classes will deal a lot more damage to certain opponents than others, and some will be much more defensive against certain opponents. It is important to learn the basics of the class bonus system &ndash; they will be explained to you in the game. Just make sure you're paying attention to it and not writing it down as minor. It's not.</p>
<p>Level up your highest ranked heroes first. You may be tempted to level up your 1-Star heroes to make them better suited to the rest of your team, but don't do this. It's best to upgrade your 2 and 3 star heroes before anyone else to make the most of their special abilities. Prioritize higher ranked heroes and then level up weaker heroes.</p>
<p>Don't skip Arena matches. The benefits of Arena matches are fundamental to the game &ndash; although you may lose your winning streak. However, don't pass up opportunities to show off your stuff to other players in the Arena unless you're absolutely not confident you can win.</p>
<p>Cheer up your heroes. Don't fall into the temptation to sell your heroes for quick cash, even if you think you won't need them. You will be surprised how quickly you will regret doing this.</p>
<p>Even low-ranked heroes can be placed through the Arena roster and you'll earn more crystals for doing this. Furthermore, there are three out of three arenas that actually require you to have a low stat hero in your squad. For these reasons, it is essential that you do not eliminate your heroes in the game!</p>
<p>Insult is the best defense. When fighting, we recommend rushing straight in to attack, rather than waiting for the enemy to come to you first. The reason for this is that you will instantly weaken their HP and then you can score bonus points on them in weakened state. It is better to do this than to let them come to you first, as the opposite will happen if you do this.</p>
